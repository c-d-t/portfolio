  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>I used to have a small HTML website that I called my portfolio. There was many problems with it, the main one being it was a pain to update. If I wanted to edit an image, I would have to go into the source code and find the exact spot the &lt;img&gt; tag was. And if I wanted to add a new project, I had to copy paste an old project and update it&rsquo;s content. It wasn&rsquo;t pretty. I usually make my projects with react, but I felt like it was a little overkill for the purposes of a portfolio. I needed a way to just write content and have that content turned into HTML.</p>
<h2 id="presenting-hugo">Presenting&hellip; Hugo</h2>
<p>Hugo is a static site generator which means it makes creating static sites easy with templates. Hugo was exactly what I needed. It&rsquo;s simple workflow makes it incredibly easy to create your HTML once and reuse it over and over again with as much content as you want. There are a ton of premade themes as well which can drop your time coding down to nothing, though I decided to make my own theme because I like having as much control as possible with my projects.</p>

  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>Trist is sort of a toy project of mine I have been using to learn web development. I am currently on my third iteration of Trist since I always run into the same problem as I make this site. I make the account registration, user friendships, and messaging, but I&rsquo;m quickly overwhelmed by the sheer size of a project at the scale of a social network.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-did-i-do">So What Did I Do?</h2>
<p>My first two attempts both had the same problem. I had no plan before starting programming. This time, I spent some time learning about software architecture and project structure. More specifically Domain Driven Design and how to separate my project into modules.</p>
<h2 id="howd-it-go">How&rsquo;d It Go?</h2>
<p>Initially, I felt like not much progress had been made. There was a lot of boilerplate I needed to set up and I had to stop myself from using a lot of little hacks I had gotten into the habit of using. But after this initial hurdle, I found that following an architecture style helped me heaps to overcome the spaghetti code that I had gotten so used to creating. Adding new features didn&rsquo;t have me rereading parts of my code which seem to have completely no relationship with the feature and there is something super satisfying about being able to look into a project directory and knowing exactly where everything is and what it does. Overall, I think it went exceedingly well and I have been applying what I learned in my later projects.</p>

## About

Trist is sort of a toy project of mine I have been using to learn web development. I am currently on my third iteration of Trist since I always run into the same problem as I make this site. I make the account registration, user friendships, and messaging, but I'm quickly overwhelmed by the sheer size of a project at the scale of a social network.

## So What Did I Do?

My first two attempts both had the same problem. I had no plan before starting programming. This time, I spent some time learning about software architecture and project structure. More specifically Domain Driven Design and how to separate my project into modules.

## How'd It Go?

Initially, I felt like not much progress had been made. There was a lot of boilerplate I needed to set up and I had to stop myself from using a lot of little hacks I had gotten into the habit of using. But after this initial hurdle, I found that following an architecture style helped me heaps to overcome the spaghetti code that I had gotten so used to creating. Adding new features didn't have me rereading parts of my code which seem to have completely no relationship with the feature and there is something super satisfying about being able to look into a project directory and knowing exactly where everything is and what it does. Overall, I think it went exceedingly well and I have been applying what I learned in my later projects.
